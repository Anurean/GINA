Happy Birthday Jane. 
Hopefully I have Gina's money restored and made her more money. 
I gave her job of C.E.O. of I.B.M. to help pay for that Japanese Stock that I sort of stoled from her. Is she still alive? 
Did she have to go to the bomb shelter system? We need to move her into plain sight and elsewhere out of State so she isn't in too much trouble being a hacker ninja-turtle.... 
because that is like 40 Felonies.


Jane, pick up some coffee and bring it to me. 
I want it from here https://www.instagram.com/fairgrinds/
and I want a Mint Moccha. 

I am at the Sharehouse in Vancouver Washington USA (I am not in Canada) I am just north of Portland Oregon by about 2 miles in a little town full of little people who build gigantic three storey koo-koo clocks and they drive me nuts. 
I have been kidnapped by midget extortionists and I need a ride to my office wherever my office is.
