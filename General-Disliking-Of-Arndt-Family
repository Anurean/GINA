Subject: Gina...
Sorry I got Gina in trouble over Etherium. 
Hopefully me giving her the easy job at IBM will pay for the stock she accidentally bought.
Too, hopefully it will make me money to have her as the C.E.O. of I.B.M.



So... if not of IBM as a whole, that does make her my CEO....

Which yes, I am a spechul little unicorn with stocks and estate bringing in multi-billion dollar revinue.
The sulfur pits are in Wyoming.
We supply BlackCat, Disney, Crayola, etc.

Anyone who buys this....
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_occult_symbols#/media/File:Alchemy_sulfur_symbol.svg

buys from us. 
I have never been paid off my 11% of the claim and right to mine sulfur in Wyoming.

It's the alchemical symbols for sulfur.
It's known as a 'Leviathan Cross' or 'Satan's Cross'.

Can someone get ahold of Sou Artesã?
I understand Melody is working in a sweat-shop again.
I need more business and things, and I am sure she wants more liberation.


That cross...
Is sort of a symbol....
That is a sigil representative of my family.

That is a patriarchal cross...
and an infinity knot.


It means for ETERNITY my patriarchy will rule and dominate the entire known world.
Part of that..
Is worthless bitchass IBM.





Does Gina Trapani have her paycheck yet?
Infact...


Where the fuck is my paycheck?
If it is demanded that I be homeless for 10 years after having bought my fucking house and then told I suddenly have stock in a corporation that I have always fucking goddamn hated....


Then you better bitch fork over a pay check for putting up with you little niggers, cunts, and christians....
and not killing and eating your goddamn worthless asses.






I am given foodstamps....
Only to keep from eating people.
My foodstamps, are a reward for good behavior and politeness.


Without them: IBM gets their asses axe murdered all over the planet.
